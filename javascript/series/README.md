# Series

Write a program that will take a string of digits and give you all the possible consecutive number series of length `n` in that string.

For example, the string "01234" has the following 3-digit series:

- 012
- 123
- 234

And the following 4-digit series:

- 0123
- 1234

And if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string, you deserve
whatever you get.

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for JavaScript to
install the necessary dependencies:

## Making the Test Suite Pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ jasmine-node .
```

In many test suites all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
changing `xit` to `it`.
